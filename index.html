    <p>Hello, I'm Amanda. I am a Fullstack Software Engineer based in Grand Junction, Colorado. When I'm not at 
     my laptop coding, I am spending time with my husband and my 15 month old daughter. I am constantly striving
     for self improvement and always eager to learn more about the coding universe! Let's connect and see how I 
     can turn your visions into a reality!</p>

<h1>
    Taco Parser Project
</h1>
<p>
    I created this project to go through a .csv file that contains a list of Taco Bell locations. This project
    will print the two locations that are the farthest from each other to the console along with how far they
    are in miles. Working on this project has taught me so much about programming in the C# language! Feel free
    to check out my project more here: <a href="https://github.com/acallahan97/TacoParser">Taco Parser Project</a>

<h1>
    KanyeREST Project
</h1>
<p>
    I created this project to pull quotes from two different APIs. It loops through the APIs, making it appear
    as though celebrities Kanye West and Ron Swanson are having a conversation when you run the program. Feel 
    free to check out my project more here: <a href="https://github.com/acallahan97/KanyeREST">KanyeREST Project</a>

<h1>
    Weather Project
</h1>
<p>
    This project runs through a weather website: <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">Weather API</a>. Once you 
    create an account with them, you will get access to an API key that will allow you to run this program. 
    You'll enter in your city name and the console will print out the temperature in degrees farenheit! Feel free
    to check out my project more here: <a href="https://github.com/acallahan97/OpenWeatherMap-Exercise">Weather Project</a>
